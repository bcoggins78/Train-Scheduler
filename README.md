### UNC Coding Bootcamp Week 7 Homework Project



**[https://bcoggins78.github.io/Train-Scheduler/](https://bcoggins78.github.io/Train-Scheduler/)**

This projects theme is a train schedular.  Simply use the form to enter the name of the train, the destination city, the first train's arrival time, and the frequency in minutes.  These values are stored in Firebase and then displayed in the Train Schedule table, along with the "Next Arrival" and "Minutes Away" which is calculated using moment.js.

This project was built with:

* HTML 
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* JQuery

* Moment.js
